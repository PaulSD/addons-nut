# Home Assistant Add-on: Network UPS Tools (With fixes)

This is a temporary Add-on which incorporates some fixes for the ["Network UPS Tools"][addon-base]
Add-on in the "Home Assistant Community Add-ons" repository.  This Add-on will be removed/abandoned
once the relevant fixes are merged upstream.

For more background on NUT, see the ["Network UPS Tools" Add-on docs][addon-base-docs].

## Installation

1. Add this Add-on to Home Assistant, either using this button:

   [![Open this Add-on in your Home Assistant instance.][addon-inst-badge]][addon-inst]

   Or by going to "Settings" -> "Add-ons" -> "Add-on store" (bottom right)
   -> Menu button (three dots, top right) -> "Repositories"
   -> Add https://github.com/PaulSD/addons-nut -> "Close" -> Search for "nut"
   -> "Network UPS Tools (With fixes)" -> "Install".

1. Copy the Add-on config from the "Network UPS Tools" Add-on to the
   "Network UPS Tools (With fixes)" Add-on: "Settings" -> "Add-ons" -> "Network UPS Tools"
   -> "Configuration" -> Menu button (three dots, top right) -> "Edit in YAML" -> Ctrl+a CTRL+c in
   the text box -> Back button (arrow, top left) -> "Network UPS Tools (With fixes)"
   -> "Configuration" -> Menu button (three dots, top right) -> "Edit in YAML" -> Ctrl+v in the text
   box -> "Save".

   If you have not previously configured the "Network UPS Tools" Add-on, then configure at least the
   `users` and `devices` options as described in the
   ["Network UPS Tools" Add-on docs][addon-base-docs-conf].
1. Stop and disable the "Network UPS Tools" Add-on ("Settings" -> "Add-ons" -> "Network UPS Tools"
   -> "Info" tab -> "Stop" -> Disable "Start on boot").  (Only one of the "Network UPS Tools" or
   "Network UPS Tools (With fixes)" Add-ons can be running at a time.)
1. Start the "Network UPS Tools (With fixes)" Add-on ("Settings" -> "Add-ons"
   -> "Network UPS Tools (With fixes)" -> "Info" tab -> "Start" -> Enable "Start on boot").
1. Check the "Logs" tab of the "Network UPS Tools (With fixes)" Add-on for any issues.
1. Note the `Hostname` listed on the "Info" tab of the "Network UPS Tools (With fixes)" Add-on.
1. Update the Hostname used by the NUT Integration: "Settings" -> "Devices & services"
   -> "Integrations" tab -> "Network UPS Tools (NUT)"
   -> Menu button (three dots) to the right of the host:port (not to the right of the UPS)
   -> "Reconfigure" -> Update the "Host" field to the Add-on Hostname identified above -> "Submit".

   If you have not previously configured the NUT Integration, then configure it according to the
   [docs][nut-ha-docs], using the Add-on Hostname identified above, Port `3493`, and the
   Username/Password configured in the Add-on.

## Configuration

This Add-on provides the same configuration options as the "Network UPS Tools" Add-on.  See that
Add-on's [config documentation][addon-base-docs-conf] for details.

## Support

For issues with the NUT software that are not related to the Home Assistant Add-on
configuration/execution environment (eg. driver/compatibility issues or crashes), see the
[NUT support instructions][nut-help].

Since this Add-on is based on the ["Network UPS Tools"][addon-base] Add-on, if you find any issues
with this Add-on's configuration/execution environment then please first check whether the issue is
also present in the "Network UPS Tools" Add-on, and if so then report the issue as described in that
Add-on's [documentation][addon-base-docs-help].

If you find an issue that is specific to this Add-on's configuration/execution environment (and is
not inherited from the "Network UPS Tools" Add-on) then you can open a [GitHub issue][github-issue].
