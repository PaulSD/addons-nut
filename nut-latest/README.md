# Home Assistant Add-on: Network UPS Tools (Latest version)

A ["Network UPS Tools"][addon-base] Add-on based on Debian Stable is already available from the
"Home Assistant Community Add-ons" repository.  However, the version of NUT in Debian Stable is
typically significantly outdated.

For users who need (or want to test with) a newer version of NUT, this Add-on is based on the
"Network UPS Tools" Add-on but it provides the version of NUT in Debian Unstable (Sid).

For information on installing and using this Add-on, see [this Add-on's documentation](DOCS.md).

For information on using NUT in Home Assistant, see the
[NUT HA Integration documentation][nut-ha-docs].
